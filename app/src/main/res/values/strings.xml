    <string name="burj_khalifa">Burj Khalifa</string>
    <string name="burj_khalifa_details">Dubai\'s landmark building is the Burj Khalifa,
        which at 829.8 meters is the tallest building in the world and the most famous
        of the city\'s points of interest. For most visitors, a trip to the observation deck on the
        124th floor here is a must­do while in the city. The views across the city
        skyline from this bird\'s­eye perspective are simply staggering. The slick
         observation deck experience includes a multimedia presentation on both
        Dubai and the building of the Burj Khalifa (completed in 2010) before a
        high­speed elevator whizzes you up to the observation deck for those
        360­degree views out across the skyscrapers to the desert on one side
        and the ocean on the other. Nighttime visits are particularly popular with
        photographers due to Dubai\'s famous city­lights panoramas. Buy your
        Burj Khalifa "At the Top" Entrance Ticket in advance to avoid long lineups,
        especially if you are planning to visit on a weekend.
    \nBack on the ground, wrapping around the Burj Khalifa, are the building\'s
        beautifully designed gardens, with winding walkways. There are plenty
        of water features including the Dubai Fountain, the world\'s tallest
        performing fountain, modeled on the famous Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas.\n

    <string name="dubai_mall">Dubai Mall</string>
    <string name="dubai_mall_details">
    Dubai Mall is the city\'s premier mall and provides entry to the Burj
    Khalifa as well as the Dubai Aquarium. There is also an ice­skating
    rink, gaming zone and cinema complex if you\'re looking for more
    entertainment options. The shopping and eating is endless and there are
    nearly always special events such as live music and fashion shows
    within the mall. The most famous of these are the annual Dubai
    Shopping Festival in January and February and the Dubai Summer
    Surprises Festival in July and August.

    <string name="sheikh_zayed_road">Sheikh Zayed Road</string>
    <string name="sheikh_zayed_road_details">
    Sheikh Zayed Road is the main thoroughfare running through Dubai\'s
    modern downtown business district. This wide, eight­lane highway is
    rimmed with towering glass, chrome, and steel high­rises along its entire
    length. It\'s one of the best on­the­ground vantage points for Dubai\'s
    famed skyscraper views. Main attractions are along, or just off, the strip
    between the roundabout and the first intersection, and most of Dubai\'s
    famous malls are located along the road\'s route. The Dubai World
    Trade Tower has an observation deck on its top floor that offers visitors
    panoramic views (a cheaper option than the Burj Khalifa), and the Gold
    and Diamond Park (Sheikh Zayed Road) is a one­stop shop for jewelry
    lovers, with 1 1 8 manufacturers and 30 retailers all under one roof.

    wooden poles, and the ceiling is constructed from palm fronds, mud, and
    plaster. In its history, the fort has served as a residence for the ruling
    family, a seat of government, garrison, and prison. Restored in 1 971
    (and again extensively in 1995), it is now the city\'s premier museum.
    The entrance has a fascinating exhibition of old maps of the Emirates
    and Dubai, showing the mammoth expansion that hit the region after the
    oil boom.
    The courtyard is home to several traditional boats and a palm­leaf
    house with an Emirati wind­tower. The right­hand hall features
    weaponry, and the left­hand hall showcases Emirati musical
    instruments. Below the ground floor are display halls with exhibits and
    dioramas covering various aspects of traditional Emirati life (including
    pearl fishing and Bedouin desert life) as well as artifacts from the 3,000­
    to 4,000­year­old graves at Al Qusais archaeological site.
    Address: Al­Fahidi Street, Al­Fahidi</string>

    <string name="bastakia_Old_dubai">Bastakia (Old Dubai)</string>
    <string name="bastakia_Old_dubai_details">
    The Bastakia Quarter (sometimes also called Al­Fahidi neighborhood)
    was built in the late 1 9th century to be the home of wealthy Persian
    merchants who dealt mainly in pearls and textiles, and were lured to
    Dubai because of the tax­free trading and access to Dubai Creek.
    Bastakia occupies the eastern portion of Bur Dubai along the creek, and
    the coral and limestone buildings here, many with walls topped with
    wind­towers, have been excellently preserved. Wind­towers provided
    the homes here with an early form of air conditioning ­ the wind trapped
    in the towers was funneled down into the houses. Persian merchants
    likely transplanted this architectural element (common in Iranian coastal
    houses) from their home country to the Gulf.
    Lined with distinct Arabian architecture, the narrow lanes are highly
    evocative of a bygone, and much slower, age in Dubai\'s history. Inside
    the district, you\'ll find the Majlis Gallery, with its collection of traditional
    Arab ceramics and furniture (housed in a wind­tower) and the XVA
    Gallery, with a contemporary art collection (located in one of the historic
    buildings)</string>

    <string name="sheikh_saeed_al_maktoum_house">Sheikh Saeed Al­Maktoum House</string>
    <string name="sheikh_saeed_al_maktoum_house_details">
    Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum was the Ruler of Dubai from 1921 to 1 958
    and grandfather to the current ruler. His former residence has been
    rebuilt and restored as a museum that is a fine example of Arabian
    architecture. The original house was built in 1896 by Sheikh Saeed\'s
    father, so he could observe shipping activity from the balconies. It was
    demolished, but the current house was rebuilt next to the original site,
    staying true to the original model by incorporating carved teak doors,
    wooden lattice screens across the windows, and gypsum ventilation
    screens with floral and geometric designs. Thirty rooms are built around
    a central courtyard with wind­tower details on top.
    Inside are the exhibits of the Dubai Museum of Historical
    Photographs and Documents, with many wonderful old photographs
    of Dubai from the period between 1 948 and 1 953. The marine wing of
    Sheikh Saeed Al­Maktoum Housethe museum has photos of fishing, pearling, and boat building.
    Throughout the building there are many letters, maps, coins, and stamps
    on display showing the development of the Emirate. Nearby is the
    Sheikh Obaid bin Thani House, restored with displays of traditional
    interiors.</string>

    <string name="dubai_creek">Dubai Creek</string>
    <string name="dubai_creek_details">
    Dubai Creek separates the city into two towns with Deira to the north
    and Bur Dubai to the south. The creek has been an influential element
    in the city\'s growth, first attracting settlers here to fish and pearl dive.
    Small villages grew up alongside the creek as far back as 4,000 years
    ago, while the modern era began in the 1830s when the Bani Yas tribe
    settled in the area. The Dhow Wharfage is located along Dubai Creek\'s
    bank, north of Al­Maktoum Bridge. Still used by small traders from
    across the Gulf, some of the dhows anchored here are well over 100
    years old. You can visit here, watching cargo being loaded and
    unloaded on and off the dhows. Dhow workers often invite visitors onto
    the vessels for a tour, where you can gain insight into the life of these
    traditional sailors. Many of the dhows here travel onwards to Kuwait,
    Iran, Oman, India, and down to Africa\'s horn. This tiny remnant of
    Dubai\'s traditional economy is still a bustling and fascinating place to
    wander around.
    To travel across the creek, you can either take a trip on one of the many
    dhows that have been restored as tourist cruise boats or take an abra
    (small wooden ferry) between the ferry points on the creek\'s Bur Dubai
    and Deira banks.</string>

    <string name="jumeirah_mosque">Jumeirah Mosque</string>
    <string name="jumeirah_mosque_details">
    Jumeirah Mosque is considered by many to be the most beautiful of
    Dubai\'s mosques. An exact copy of Cairo\'s Al­Azhar Mosque that is
    eight times its size, the Jumeirah Mosque is a fine example of Islamic
    architecture. This stone structure is built in the medieval Fatimid
    tradition, with two minarets that display the subtle details in the
    stonework. It is particularly attractive in the evening when lit with
    floodlights. The Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Centre for Cultural
    Understanding (which also runs a program of tours, lectures, Arabic
    classes, and cultural meals) organizes guided tours of the mosque
    designed to try to foster a better understanding of the Muslim faith.
    Tours begin at 10am daily, except Fridays.

    <string name="deira">Deira</string>
    <string name="deira_details">
    Deira lies on the northern bank of Dubai Creek, and the winding streets
    here unveil the melting pot of different nationalities that have come to
    call Dubai home. On the shore, ancient dhows load and unload with
    modern banks, hotels, and office buildings as a backdrop. For travelers,
    Deira is most famous for its traditional souks (markets), which bustle
    with shoppers at all times of the day. Deira Gold Souk is worldrenowned
        as the largest gold bazaar in the world. The Deira Spice
    Souk sells every imaginable spice, with stalls overflowing with bags of
    frankincense, cumin, paprika, saffron, sumac, and thyme, as well as the
    fragrant oud wood, rose water, and incense. The fish market provides a
    much less touristy experience.
    While in the district, culture lovers shouldn\'t miss two of Deira\'s finely
    restored architectural gems. Heritage House was built in 1890 as the
    home of a wealthy Iranian merchant and later became the home of
    Sheik Ahmed bin Dalmouk (a famous pearl merchant in Dubai). Today,
    it\'s a great chance to see the interior of a traditional family home. The
    Al­Ahmadiya School, constructed in 1912, is the oldest school in Dubai
    and is now a museum of public education.
